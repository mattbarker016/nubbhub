Network utility to measure and track NUBB data usage at Cornell University

## Features
- Elegant graphical representation of user's total usage in the billing cycle
- Helpful usage statistics
	- Average: average data usage per day
	- Forecast: projected usage for month
	- Suggested: maximum daily data usage to stay under data limit
	- Cost: projected / actual cost due to over-usage
- Detailed information for each user's device
	- Total Usage
	- Download Amount
	- Upload Amount
- View past billing cycle data (from Aug. 2015 on)
- Eight colorful themes
- Confirguable notifcations when user's have exceeded a certain amount of data
- Guest mode, to not leave non-Cornellians left out on the fun

## Little Touches
- Intelligent presentation of statistics based on context (past v. present, if there is no cost, etc.)
- Color changes across UI if the user is going to / has exceeded the data limit
- Timeout errors that reload content (bad connection, too slow)
- dynamic theming menu that provides color palette information in a fun way
- About screen with social media links and a hidden way to send feedback
